Description: NIH D-Bus Binding Tool
 nih-dbus-tool generates C source code from the D-Bus Introspection XML
 data provided by most services; either to make implementing the
 described objects in C programs or to make proxying to the described
 remote objects easier.
 .
 The generated code requires libnih-dbus-dev to be compiled.
